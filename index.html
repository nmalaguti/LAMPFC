										<p>"I have never had more perfect <b>ginger molasses</b> cookies and I will be backed up by my family on this. Never have 2.5 dozen cookies been eaten so quickly in this household (the majority of it done by me). The cookies are the best combo and sugar and spice a person could ask for, speaking as a person who likes less sugary stuff and looooves ginger! Am definitely going to buy more in the near future as I'm almost done with my current batch and am sure I'll be dreaming about the cookies."</p>

										<p>"Because my mind was totally blown, I just wanted to let you know your cookies were absolutely amazing. Didn’t even last the weekend once they arrived. My husband loved the <b>shortbread</b> and he said it gave him flashbacks of his childhood. I got the <b>espresso cookies</b> for myself mostly and I LOVED them, it was like eating the chewy/corner part of a brownie (the best part) but it was the WHOLE thing!"</p>

										<p>“I think I've tried nearly half the cookies on this site at this point. Not only have I never had a bad cookie from Ana, I've never had so much as a so-so cookie from her. In fact, most of the ones I've tried are, like, the platonic ideal of what that cookie should be. <br><br>
											
											My favorites are the <b>Mexican hot chocolate</b> and <b>espresso brownie</b>, which are perfectly rich, chewy, and chocolatey -- somehow in COMPLETELY different ways -- but if you hold a picture of the perfect (fucking) <b>shortbread</b>, <b>peanut butter cookie</b>, etc. in your mind, that's what Ana's are like.”</p>

										<p>"Holy shit [...] the cookies are SO GOOD. I was going to concoct a complex lie about how they’re bad and you should just ship everything you’ve made to us from now on to take care of it for you but I can’t. They’re amazing. I literally can’t tell they’re [gluten free]."</p>

										<p>"I tried the <b>Lemon Shortbread</b> first. A buttery, flaky shortbread cooking with a light, lemony glaze on top! They are phenomenal. Perfect Coffee/tea biscuits [...] Ana managed to absolutely nail the tart/sweet on the lemon glaze without it overpowering the cookie. EXCELLENT.<br><br>

											Next was <b>Ricotta Chip</b>! It's a very soft, almost cake-like texture, but with a very nice creamy cookie flavour! Chocolate chips of course and just absolutely satisfying for those of us with sweet tooths (sweet teeth?). If you [...] love delicious soft cookies, this is what you wanna go for.<br><br>
											
											Finally, the <b>Earl Grey Shortbread</b>. An unexpected favourite from me! Something about the flavour and the texture of the cookie is absolutely stupendous. Again, nice crunch without being hard or crackly, all arrived intact and portioned in KAWAII BARS. Deliciously buttery, I'm gonna be chomping them with my coffee this whole weekend."</p>

									<article class="item">
										<p>"I love Ana's baking! The extent to which I love all the cookies I've gotten from her is that I have to carefully ration myself to one a day because if I did not, I would pretty much scarf them down immediately. I've ordered a range of cookies from her, but my favorites for sure are her tea-infused <b>shortbreads</b>. It's awesome how much flavor she packs into them and they are buttery and delicate.<br><br>

											I'm also a HUGE fan of the <b>mexican hot chocolate cookies</b> I ordered. They're spicy and rich and they've gone over really well with my household!"</p>

									<article class="item">
										<p>"I've never had cookies quite like the <b>ricotta chip</b> but they're always soft, fluffy and incredibly delicious! The <b>lemon shortbread</b> is one that I've had before and knew I would like, but then she added a glaze that made them even more amazing. The <b>Earl Grey shortbread</b> cookies were a new flavor to me but are also tasty and I'm looking forward to eating more of them."</p>

										<p>"These cookies are fantastic. They didn't even last a week in my house, and every time someone grabbed one they were quickly coming back for more. Went perfect with my tea -- and every other meal. They arrived quickly, were still in one piece, and the taste was as if they were just handed to me from the oven. Minus the heat, of course. I've come back for seconds, and will make plans for a third and a forth time in the future."</p>

										<p>"These are hands down the best cookies I have ever had. No matter what your liking, she has something for everyone. Every cookie brings pure happiness with its perfect flavor paired with its amazing texture. Ana is always willing to take custom orders and her customer service is impeccable. Trust me, you will not be disappointed. I highly recommend the <b>earl grey shortbread</b> cookies!"</p>
